# Branch Energy Open Source

[Branch Energy](https://branchenergy.com/) is on a mission to help people lower their energy
bills and reduce their carbon footprint. This mission involves a wide array of open source software,
and this organisation on GitHub hosts our own efforts in open source!

Our [Engineering Blog](https://branchenergy.github.io/) discusses our projects in GitHub in more
detail.
